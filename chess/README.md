# Chess-Analysis
### Why

### How
- Clone and build Stockfish and lc0: `./build_chess_engines.sh`
- Activate Python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- Install Pip requirements: `pip3 install -r ../requirements.txt`
- Test Stockfish integration: `python3 test_stockfish.py`
- Test lc0 integration: `python3 test_lc0.py`
- Play Stockfish against Leela: `python3 stockfish_vs_leela.py`
- Analyze a famous game move by move: `python3 game-analysis.py`

Run the Python scripts from this directory: they expect the engines at `./Stockfish/src/stockfish` and `./lc0/build/lc0`.
