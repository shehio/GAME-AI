# Game AI
This is a repository to study AI in games. It investigates classical search methods, like graph-based and tree-based and classical Reinforcement Learning methods with tabular Q function and more modern approaches relying on a policy network.
The plan is to extend this repo to cover more of challenging game states and action spaces, focusing on sample efficiency and computation resources.
We start with having the two top chess engines play against each other.
