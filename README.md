### Why
This is a repository to study AI in games.
Investigating tree-based methods and Reinforcement Learning with a policy network on different scale of action spaces.
The plan is to extend this repo to cover more of challenges in gameplay, not on the implemtation side, but on the scaling side.

### How
- Clone and build Stockfish and lc0: `./build_engines.sh`
- Activate Python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- Install Pip requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Test Stockfish integration `python3 test_stockfish.py`
